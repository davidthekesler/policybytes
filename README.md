### Getting Started: 

Required:

Once the database is set up, to run a development build on your own machine: 
1) Clone/download Repository
2) `npm install`
3) Initialize Facebook Auth by setting up a .env file with a Facebook FACEBOOK_APP_ID and FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET
For local development you'll need to run two server: <br/> 
4) `npm run server`
5) `npm run client` 

Note: Because of the Facebook Auth strategy the development server runs on an https:// URL. This URL is not actually secure so your brower my warn you that it is unsafe.
